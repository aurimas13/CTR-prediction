There are two jupyter notebooks - one is [the complete final version](https://github.com/aurimas13/CTR-prediction/blob/main/CTR_prediction_final.ipynb) while the other is [the trial one](https://github.com/aurimas13/CTR-prediction/blob/main/CTR_prediction.ipynb) that contains additional information such as trying logistic regression and ha supplementary information to replenish my memory on things like how to import files if the path is different.
