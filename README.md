# CTR-prediction

This whole repo consists of a developed full Machine Learning model to predict Click Through Rate (CTR) examples of [Avazu data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction) from '13. There are two jupyter notebooks - one is [the complete final version](https://github.com/aurimas13/CTR-prediction/blob/main/CTR_prediction_final.ipynb) while the other is [the trial one](https://github.com/aurimas13/CTR-prediction/blob/main/CTR_prediction.ipynb) that contains additional information such as trying logistic regression and has supplementary information to replenish my memory on things like how to import files if the path is different.

# Final
[(Back to top)](#CTR-prediction)

This is the [final version](https://github.com/aurimas13/CTR-prediction/blob/main/CTR_prediction_final.ipynb) of CTR prediction ML model. It provides Data collection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Modelling with Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier and a Conclusion.

# Trial
[(Back to top)](#CTR-prediction)

This it the [trial version](https://github.com/aurimas13/CTR-prediction/blob/main/CTR_prediction.ipynb) of CTR presidction ML model. It provides Data collection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Modelling with Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier followed by Adam Optimization, SGDC Classifier and Logistic Regression tryouts.
